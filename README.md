# AI_Project
It is a Robot which can run 3 modes. Project1.ino is for 1st mode and Project2.ino is for 2nd mode. If we want to run the project, we will 
need a arduino board. When we copy code pc to arduino, we need to turn on a switch. Then the robort will power on. The project has another 2 switchs. When we give 0 & 1, the robort will move in the mode 1. Again when we give 1 & 0,  the robort will move in the mode 2.
